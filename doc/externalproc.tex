\subsection{externalproc}
\label{labexternalproc}
\noindent Name: \textbf{externalproc}\\
binds an external code to a Sollya procedure\\

\noindent Usage: 
\begin{center}
\textbf{externalproc}(\emph{identifier}, \emph{filename}, \emph{argumenttype} $->$ \emph{resulttype}) : (\textsf{identifier type}, \textsf{string}, \textsf{type type}, \textsf{type type}) $\rightarrow$ \textsf{void}\\
\end{center}
Parameters: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{identifier} represents the identifier the code is to be bound to
\item \emph{filename} of type \textsf{string} represents the name of the object file where the code of procedure can be found
\item \emph{argumenttype} represents a definition of the types of the arguments of the Sollya procedure and the external code
\item \emph{resulttype} represents a definition of the result type of the external code
\end{itemize}
\noindent Description: \begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{externalproc} allows for binding the Sollya identifier
   \emph{identifier} to an external code.  After this binding, when Sollya
   encounters \emph{identifier} applied to a list of actual parameters, it
   will evaluate these parameters and call the external code with these
   parameters. If the external code indicated success, it will receive
   the result produced by the external code, transform it to Sollya's
   iternal representation and return it.
    
   In order to allow correct evaluation and typing of the data in
   parameter and in result to be passed to and received from the external
   code, \textbf{externalproc} has a third parameter \emph{argumenttype} $->$ \emph{resulttype}.
   Both \emph{argumenttype} and \emph{resulttype} are one of void, constant,
   function, range, integer, string, boolean, list of constant, list of
   function, list of range, list of integer, list of string, list of
   boolean.
    
   If upon a usage of a procedure bound to an external procedure the type
   of the actual parameters given or its number is not correct, Sollya
   produces a type error. An external function not applied to arguments
   represents itself and prints out with its argument and result types.
    
   The external function is supposed to return an integer indicating
   success.  It returns its result depending on its Sollya result type
   as follows. Here, the external procedure is assumed to be implemented
   as a C function.
    
   If the Sollya result type is void, the C function has no pointer
   argument for the result.  If the Sollya result type is constant, the
   first argument of the C function is of C type \texttt{mpfr\_t *}, the result is
   returned by affecting the MPFR variable.  If the Sollya result type
   is function, the first argument of the C function is of C type §§node
   **§\texttt{node **}§§, the result is returned by the \texttt{node *} pointed with a new \texttt{node *}.
   If the Sollya result type is range, the first argument of the C
   function is of C type \texttt{mpfi\_t *}, the result is returned by affecting
   the MPFI variable.  If the Sollya result type is integer, the first
   argument of the C function is of C type \texttt{int *}, the result is returned
   by affecting the int variable.  If the Sollya result type is string,
   the first argument of the C function is of C type \texttt{char **}, the result
   is returned by the \texttt{char *} pointed with a new \texttt{char *}.  If the Sollya
   result type is boolean, the first argument of the C function is of C
   type \texttt{int *}, the result is returned by affecting the int variable with
   a boolean value.  If the Sollya result type is list of type, the
   first argument of the C function is of C type \texttt{chain **}, the result is
   returned by the \texttt{chain *} pointed with a new \texttt{chain *}.  This chain
   contains for Sollya type constant pointers \texttt{mpfr\_t *} to new MPFR
   variables, for Sollya type function pointers \texttt{node *} to new nodes, for
   Sollya type range pointers \texttt{mpfi\_t *}  to new MPFI variables, for
   Sollya type integer pointers \texttt{int *} to new int variables for Sollya
   type string pointers \texttt{char *} to new \texttt{char *} variables and for Sollya
   type boolean pointers \texttt{int *} to new int variables representing boolean
   values.
    	       
   The external procedure affects its possible pointer argument if and
   only if it succeeds.  This means, if the function returns an integer
   indicating failure, it does not leak any memory to the encompassing
   environment.
    
   The external procedure receives its arguments as follows: If the
   Sollya argument type is void, no argument array is given.  Otherwise
   the C function receives a C \texttt{void **} argument representing an array of
   size equal to the arity of the function where each entry (of C type
   \texttt{void *}) represents a value with a C type depending on the
   corresponding Sollya type. If the Sollya type is constant, the C
   type the \texttt{void *} is to be casted to is \texttt{mpfr\_t *}.  If the Sollya type
   is function, the C type the \texttt{void *} is to be casted to is \texttt{node *}.  If
   the Sollya type is range, the C type the \texttt{void *} is to be casted to is
   \texttt{mpfi\_t *}.  If the Sollya type is integer, the C type the \texttt{void *} is to
   be casted to is \texttt{int *}.  If the Sollya type is string, the C type the
   \texttt{void *} is to be casted to is \texttt{char *}.  If the Sollya type is boolean,
   the C type the \texttt{void *} is to be casted to is \texttt{int *}.  If the Sollya
   type is list of type, the C type the \texttt{void *} is to be casted to is
   \texttt{chain *}.  Here depending on type, the values in the chain are to be
   casted to \texttt{mpfr\_t *}  for Sollya type constant, \texttt{node *} for Sollya type
   function, \texttt{mpfi\_t *} for Sollya type range, \texttt{int *} for Sollya type
   integer, \texttt{char *} for Sollya type string and \texttt{int *} for Sollya type
   boolean.
    
   The external procedure is not supposed to alter the memory pointed by
   its array argument \texttt{void **}.
    
   In both directions (argument and result values), empty lists are
   represented by \texttt{chain * NULL} pointers.
    
   In contrast to internal procedures, externally bounded procedures can
   be considered as objects inside Sollya that can be assigned to other
   variables, stored in list etc.
