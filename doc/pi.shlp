#NAME $PI
#QUICK_DESCRIPTION the constant §§Pi§$\pi$§§.

#LIBRARYNAME sollya_obj_t sollya_lib_pi()
#LIBRARYNAME int sollya_lib_is_pi(sollya_obj_t)
#LIBRARYNAME sollya_obj_t sollya_lib_build_function_pi()
#LIBRARYNAME #define SOLLYA_PI (sollya_lib_build_function_pi())

#DESCRIPTION 
$COMMAND is the constant §§Pi§$\pi$§§, defined as half the period of sine and cosine.

#DESCRIPTION
In $SOLLYA, $COMMAND is considered a 0-ary function. This way, the constant 
is not evaluated at the time of its definition but at the time of its use. For 
instance, when you define a constant or a function relating to §§Pi§$\pi$§§, the current
precision at the time of the definition does not matter. What is important is 
the current precision when you evaluate the function or the constant value.

#DESCRIPTION
Remark that when you define an interval, the bounds are first evaluated and 
then the interval is defined. In this case, $COMMAND will be evaluated as any 
other constant value at the definition time of the interval, thus using the 
current precision at this time.
