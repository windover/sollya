\subsection{ hopitalrecursions }
\noindent Name: \textbf{hopitalrecursions}\\
controls the number of recursion steps when applying L'Hopital's rule.\\

\noindent Description: \begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{hopitalrecursions} is a global variable. Its value represents the number of steps of
   recursion that are tried when applying L'Hopital's rule. This rule is applied
   by the interval evaluator present in the core of Sollya (and particularly
   visible in commands like \textbf{infnorm}).

\item If an expression of the form $f/g$ has to be evaluated by interval 
   arithmetic on an interval $I$ and if $f$ and $g$ have a common zero
   in $I$, a direct evaluation leads to NaN.
   Sollya implements a safe heuristic to avoid this, based on L'Hopital's rule: in 
   such a case, it can be shown that $(f/g)(I) \subseteq (f'/g')(I)$. Since
   the same problem may hold for $f'/g'$, the rule is applied recursively.
   The number of step in this recursion process is controlled by \textbf{hopitalrecursions}.

\item Setting \textbf{hopitalrecursions} to 0 makes Sollya use this rule only one time ;
   setting it to 1 makes Sollya use the rule two times, and so on.
   In particular: the rule is always applied at least once, if necessary.
