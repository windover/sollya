\subsection{restart}
\label{labrestart}
\noindent Name: \textbf{restart}\\
brings \sollya back to its initial state\\
\noindent Usage: 
\begin{center}
\textbf{restart} : \textsf{void} $\rightarrow$ \textsf{void}\\
\end{center}
\noindent Description: \begin{itemize}

\item The command \textbf{restart} brings \sollya back to its initial state.  All
   current state is abandoned, all libraries unbound and all memory freed.
    
   The \textbf{restart} command has no effect when executed inside a \sollya
   script read into a main \sollya script using \textbf{execute}. It is executed
   in a \sollya script included by a $\#$include macro.
    
   Using the \textbf{restart} command in nested elements of imperative
   programming like for or while loops is possible. Since in most cases
   abandoning the current state of \sollya means altering a loop
   invariant, warnings for the impossibility of continuing a loop may
   follow unless the state is rebuilt.
\end{itemize}
\noindent Example 1: 
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{15cm}\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
> print(exp(x));
exp(x)
> a = 3;
> restart;
The tool has been restarted.
> print(x);
x
> a;
Warning: the identifier "a" is neither assigned to, nor bound to a library funct
ion nor external procedure, nor equal to the current free variable.
Will interpret "a" as "x".
x
\end{Verbatim}
\end{minipage}\end{center}
\noindent Example 2: 
\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{15cm}\begin{Verbatim}[frame=single]
> print(exp(x));
exp(x)
> for i from 1 to 10 do {
      print(i);
      if (i == 5) then restart;
  };

The tool has been restarted.
Warning: the tool has been restarted inside a for loop.
The for loop will no longer be executed.
