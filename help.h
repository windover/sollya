This means, if checkinfnorm\n   evaluates to true, the infinite norm has been proven (by Sollya's\n   interval arithmetic) to be less than the bound. If checkinfnorm evaluates\n   to false, there are two possibilities: either the bound is less than\n   or equal to the infinite norm of the function or the bound is greater\n   than the infinite norm but Sollya could not conclude using its\n   internal interval arithmetic.\n    \n   checkinfnorm is sensitive to the global variable diam. The smaller diam,\n   the more time Sollya will spend on the evaluation of checkinfnorm in\n   order to prove the bound before returning false although the infinite\n   is bounded by the bound. If diam is equal to 0, Sollya will\n   eventually spend infinite time on instances where the given bound\n   {bound} is less or equal to the infinite norm of the function\n   {function} in range {range}. In contrast, with diam being zero,\n   checkinfnorm evaluates to true iff the infinite norm of the function in\n   the range is bounded by the given bound.\n\nExample 1: \n   > checkinfnorm(sin(x),[0;1.75], 1);\n   true\n   > checkinfnorm(sin(x),[0;1.75], 1/2); checkinfnorm(sin(x),[0;20/39],\n   false\n   > 1/2);\n   true\n\nExample 2: \n   > p = remez(exp(x), 5, [-1;1]);\n   > b = dirtyinfnorm(p - exp(x), [-1;1]);\n   > checkinfnorm(p - exp(x), [-1;1], b);\n   false\n   > b1 = round(b, 20, RU);\n   > checkinfnorm(p - exp(x), [-1;1], b1);\n   true\n   > b2 = round(b, 25, RU);\n   > checkinfnorm(p - exp(x), [-1;1], b2);\n   false\n   > diam = 1b-20!;\n   > checkinfnorm(p - exp(x), [-1;1], b2);\n   true\n\nSee also: infnorm, dirtyinfnorm, accurateinfnorm, remez, diam\n"

After this binding, when Sollya\n   encounters {identifier} applied to a list of actual parameters, it\n   will evaluate these parameters and call the external code with these\n   parameters. If the external code indicated success, it will receive\n   the result produced by the external code, transform it to Sollya's\n   iternal representation and return it.\n    \n   In order to allow correct evaluation and typing of the data in\n   parameter and in result to be passed to and received from the external\n   code, externalproc has a third parameter {argumenttype} -> {resulttype}.\n   Both {argumenttype} and {resulttype} are one of void, constant,\n   function, range, integer, string, boolean, list of constant, list of\n   function, list of range, list of integer, list of string, list of\n   boolean.\n    \n   If upon a usage of a procedure bound to an external procedure the type\n   of the actual parameters given or its number is not correct, Sollya\n   produces a type error. An external function not applied to arguments\n   represents itself and prints out with its argument and result types.\n    \n   The external function is supposed to return an integer indicating\n   success.  It returns its result depending on its Sollya result type\n   as follows. Here, the external procedure is assumed to be implemented\n   as a C function.\n    \n   If the Sollya result type is void, the C function has no pointer\n   argument for the result.  If the Sollya result type is constant, the\n   first argument of the C function is of C type mpfr_t *, the result is\n   returned by affecting the MPFR variable.  If the Sollya result type\n   is function, the first argument of the C function is of C type node\n   **, the result is returned by the node * pointed with a new node *.\n   If the Sollya result type is range, the first argument of the C\n   function is of C type mpfi_t *, the result is returned by affecting\n   the MPFI variable.  If the Sollya result type is integer, the first\n   argument of the C function is of C type int *, the result is returned\n   by affecting the int variable.  If the Sollya result type is string,\n   the first argument of the C function is of C type char **, the result\n   is returned by the char * pointed with a new char *.  If the Sollya\n   result type is boolean, the first argument of the C function is of C\n   type int *, the result is returned by affecting the int variable with\n   a boolean value.  If the Sollya result type is list of type, the\n   first argument of the C function is of C type chain **, the result is\n   returned by the chain * pointed with a new chain *.  This chain\n   contains for Sollya type constant pointers mpfr_t * to new MPFR\n   variables, for Sollya type function pointers node * to new nodes, for\n   Sollya type range pointers mpfi_t * to new MPFI variables, for\n   Sollya type integer pointers int * to new int variables for Sollya\n   type string pointers char * to new char * variables and for Sollya\n   type boolean pointers int * to new int variables representing boolean\n   values.\n    \t       \n   The external procedure affects its possible pointer argument if and\n   only if it succeeds.  This means, if the function returns an integer\n   indicating failure, it does not leak any memory to the encompassing\n   environment.\n    \n   The external procedure receives its arguments as follows: If the\n   Sollya argument type is void, no argument array is given.  Otherwise\n   the C function receives a C void ** argument representing an array of\n   size equal to the arity of the function where each entry (of C type\n   void *) represents a value with a C type depending on the\n   corresponding Sollya type. If the Sollya type is constant, the C\n   type the void * is to be casted to is mpfr_t *.  If the Sollya type\n   is function, the C type the void * is to be casted to is node *.  If\n   the Sollya type is range, the C type the void * is to be casted to is\n   mpfi_t *.  If the Sollya type is integer, the C type the void * is to\n   be casted to is int *.  If the Sollya type is string, the C type the\n   void * is to be casted to is char *.  If the Sollya type is boolean,\n   the C type the void * is to be casted to is int *.  If the Sollya\n   type is list of type, the C type the void * is to be casted to is\n   chain *.  Here depending on type, the values in the chain are to be\n   casted to mpfr_t * for Sollya type constant, node * for Sollya type\n   function, mpfi_t * for Sollya type range, int * for Sollya type\n   integer, char * for Sollya type string and int * for Sollya type\n   boolean.\n    \n   The external procedure is not supposed to alter the memory pointed by\n   its array argument void **.\n    \n   In both directions (argument and result values), empty lists are\n   represented by chain * NULL pointers.\n    \n   In contrast to internal procedures, externally bounded procedures can\n   be considered as objects inside Sollya that can be assigned to other\n   variables, stored in list etc.\n\nExample 1: \n   > bashexecute(\"gcc -fPIC -Wall -c externalprocexample.c\");\n   > bashexecute(\"gcc -fPIC -shared -o externalprocexample externalprocexample.o\");\n   > externalproc(foo, \"./externalprocexample\", (integer, integer) -> integer);\n   > foo;\n   foo(integer, integer) -> integer\n   > foo(5, 6);\n   11\n   > verbosity = 1!;\n   > foo();\n   Warning: at least one of the given expressions or a subexpression is not correctly typed\n   or its evaluation has failed because of some error on a side-effect.\n   error\n   > a = foo;\n   > a(5,6);\n   11\n\nSee also: library, externalplot, bashexecute, void, constant, function, range, integer, string, boolean, list of\n"

This rule is applied\n   by the interval evaluator present in the core of Sollya (and particularly\n   visible in commands like infnorm).\n\n   * If an expression of the form f/g has to be evaluated by interval \n   arithmetic on an interval I and if f and g have a common zero\n   in I, a direct evaluation leads to NaN.\n   Sollya implements a safe heuristic to avoid this, based on L'Hopital's rule: in \n   such a case, it can be shown that (f/g)(I) C (f'/g')(I). Since\n   the same problem may hold for f'/g', the rule is applied recursively.\n   The number of step in this recursion process is controlled by hopitalrecursions.\n\n   * Setting hopitalrecursions to 0 makes Sollya use this rule only one time ;\n   setting it to 1 makes Sollya use the rule two times, and so on.\n   In particular: the rule is always applied at least once, if necessary.\n\nExample 1: \n   > hopitalrecursions=0;\n   The number of recursions for Hopital's rule has been set to 0.\n   > evaluate(log(1+x)^2/x^2,[-1/2; 1]);\n   [-@Inf@;@Inf@]\n   > hopitalrecursions=1;\n   The number of recursions for Hopital's rule has been set to 1.\n   > evaluate(log(1+x)^2/x^2,[-1/2; 1]);\n   [-0.252258872223978123766892848583270627230200053744108e1;0.677258872223978123766892848583270627230200053744116e1]\n\n"

The produced code is output in a file named {filename}. The\n   argument {format} indicates the double, double-double or triple-double\n   format of the variable in which the polynomial varies, influencing\n   also in the signature of the C function.\n    \n   If a seventh or eightth argument {proof filename} is given and if this\n   argument evaluates to a variable of type string, the command\n   implementpoly will produce a Gappa proof that the\n   rounding error is less than the given bound. This proof will be output\n   in Gappa syntax in a file name {proof filename}.\n    \n   The command implementpoly returns the polynomial that has been\n   implemented. As the command implementpoly tries to adapt the precision\n   needed in each evaluation step to its strict minimum and as it\n   renormalizes double-double and triple-double precision coefficients to\n   a round-to-nearest expansion, the polynomial return may differ from\n   the polynomial {polynomial}. Nevertheless the difference will be small\n   enough that the rounding error bound with regard to the polynomial\n   {polynomial} (estimated at its first order) will be less than the\n   given error bound.\n    \n   If a seventh argument {honor coefficient precisions} is given and\n   evaluates to a variable honorcoeffprec of type honorcoeffprec,\n   implementpoly will honor the precision of the given polynomial\n   {polynomials}. This means if a coefficient needs a double-double or a\n   triple-double to be exactly stored, implementpoly will allocate appropriate\n   space and use a double-double or triple-double operation even if the\n   automatic (heuristical) determination implemented in command implementpoly\n   indicates that the coefficient could be stored on less precision or,\n   respectively, the operation could be performed with less\n   precision. The use of honorcoeffprec has advantages and\n   disadvantages. If the polynomial {polynomial} given has not been\n   determined by a process considering directly polynomials with\n   floating-point coefficients, honorcoeffprec should not be\n   indicated. The implementpoly command can then determine the needed\n   precision using the same error estimation as used for the\n   determination of the precisions of the operations. Generally, the\n   coefficients will get rounded to double, double-double and\n   triple-double precision in a way that minimizes their number and\n   respects the rounding error bound {error bound}.  Indicating\n   honorcoeffprec may in this case short-circuit most precision\n   estimations leading to sub-optimal code. On the other hand, if the\n   polynomial {polynomial} has been determined with floating-point\n   precisions in mind, honorcoeffprec should be indicated because such\n   polynomials often are very sensitive in terms of error propgation with\n   regard to their coefficients' values. Indicating honorcoeffprec\n   prevents the implementpoly command from rounding the coefficients and\n   altering by many orders of magnitude approximation error of the\n   polynomial with regard to the function it approximates.\n    \n   The implementer behind the implementpoly command makes some assumptions on\n   its input and verifies them. If some assumption cannot be verified,\n   the implementation will not succeed and implementpoly will evaluate to a\n   variable error of type error. The same behaviour is observed if\n   some file is not writeable or some other side-effect fails, e.g. if\n   the implementer runs out of memory.\n    \n   As error estimation is performed only on the first order, the code\n   produced by the implementpoly command should be considered valid iff a\n   Gappa proof has been produced and successfully run\n   in Gappa.\n\nExample 1: \n   > implementpoly(1 - 1/6 * x^2 + 1/120 * x^4, [-1b-10;1b-10], 1b-30, D, \"p\",\"implementation.c\");\n   1 + x^2 * ((-0.1666666666666666574148081281236954964697360992431640625) + x^2 * 0.833333333333333321768510160154619370587170124053955078125e-2)\n   > readfile(\"implementation.c\");\n   #define p_coeff_0h 1.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e+00\n   #define p_coeff_2h -1.66666666666666657414808128123695496469736099243164062500000000000000000000000000e-01\n   #define p_coeff_4h 8.33333333333333321768510160154619370587170124053955078125000000000000000000000000e-03\n   \n   \n   void p(double *p_resh, double x) {\n   double p_x_0_pow2h;\n   \n   \n   p_x_0_pow2h = x * x;\n   \n   \n   double p_t_1_0h;\n   double p_t_2_0h;\n   double p_t_3_0h;\n   double p_t_4_0h;\n   double p_t_5_0h;\n    \n   \n   \n   p_t_1_0h = p_coeff_4h;\n   p_t_2_0h = p_t_1_0h * p_x_0_pow2h;\n   p_t_3_0h = p_coeff_2h + p_t_2_0h;\n   p_t_4_0h = p_t_3_0h * p_x_0_pow2h;\n   p_t_5_0h = p_coeff_0h + p_t_4_0h;\n   *p_resh = p_t_5_0h;\n   \n   \n   }\n   \n\nExample 2: \n   > implementpoly(1 - 1/6 * x^2 + 1/120 * x^4, [-1b-10;1b-10], 1b-30, D, \"p\",\"implementation.c\",\"implementation.gappa\");\n   1 + x^2 * ((-0.1666666666666666574148081281236954964697360992431640625) + x^2 * 0.833333333333333321768510160154619370587170124053955078125e-2)\n   > readfile(\"implementation.gappa\");\n   # The polynomial to implement is: (1b0 - ((x^(1b1)) / 3b1)) + ((x^(1b2)) / 15b3)\n   # The polynomial implemented is: 1b0 + (x * (0 + (x * ((-6004799503160661b-55) + (x * (0 + (x * 4803839602528529b-59)))))))\n   # The domain is [-1b-10;1b-10]\n   # The free variable x is a double precision number, the result p_res* is stored on a double precision number.\n   # The code produces 10 intermediate and final arithmetical approximations.\n   \n   # Double precision rounding operator:\n   @double = float<ieee_64,ne>;\n   \n   # Disable some annoying warnings:\n   #@-Wno-dichotomy-failure\n   \n   # Helper definitions for decomposing the free variable\n   xh = x;\n   \n   # Transcription of the C code\n   p_coeff_0h = double(1.00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000e+00);\n   \n   p_coeff_2h = double(-1.66666666666666657414808128123695496469736099243164062500000000000000000000000000e-01);\n   \n   p_coeff_4h = double(8.33333333333333321768510160154619370587170124053955078125000000000000000000000000e-03);\n   \n   p_x_0_pow2h = double(xh * xh);\n   p_t_1_0h = p_coeff_4h;\n   \n   p_t_2_0h = double(p_t_1_0h * p_x_0_pow2h);\n   p_t_3_0h = double(p_coeff_2h + p_t_2_0h);\n   p_t_4_0h = double(p_t_3_0h * p_x_0_pow2h);\n   p_t_5_0h = double(p_coeff_0h + p_t_4_0h);\n   p_resh = p_t_5_0h;\n   \n   \n   # Mathematical equivalents\n   Mx = x;\n   Mp_coeff_0 = p_coeff_0h;\n   Mp_coeff_2 = p_coeff_2h;\n   Mp_coeff_4 = p_coeff_4h;\n   Mp_x_0_pow2 = Mx * Mx;\n   Mp_t_1_0 = Mp_coeff_4;\n   Mp_t_2_0 = Mp_t_1_0 * Mp_x_0_pow2;\n   Mp_t_3_0 = Mp_coeff_2 + Mp_t_2_0;\n   Mp_t_4_0 = Mp_t_3_0 * Mp_x_0_pow2;\n   Mp_t_5_0 = Mp_coeff_0 + Mp_t_4_0;\n   Mp_res = Mp_t_5_0;\n   \n   # Definition of the relative arithmetical error\n   epsilon = (p_resh - Mp_res) / Mp_res;\n   \n   # Implication to prove\n   {((\n      x in [-1b-10,-1b-410]\n   ) \\/ (\n      x in [1b-410,1b-10]\n   ))\n   ->\n   (\n      epsilon in ?\n   )}\n   \n   # Hints and Meta-Hints for expansion decomposition\n   \n   \n   # Meta-Hints for Horner scheme\n   p_x_0_pow2h ~ Mp_x_0_pow2;\n   p_t_1_0h ~ Mp_t_1_0;\n   p_t_2_0h ~ Mp_t_2_0;\n   p_t_3_0h ~ Mp_t_3_0;\n   p_t_4_0h ~ Mp_t_4_0;\n   p_t_5_0h ~ Mp_t_5_0;\n   p_resh ~ Mp_res;\n   \n   # Dichotomies for triple-double decomposition\n   \n   # Dichotomy for the error bound\n   epsilon $ xh;\n   \n   \n\nExample 3: \n   > verbosity = 1!;\n   > q = implementpoly(1 - simplify(TD(1/6)) * x^2,[-1b-10;1b-10],1b-60,DD,\"p\",\"implementation.c\");\n   Warning: at least one of the coefficients of the given polynomial has been rounded in a way\n   that the target precision can be achieved at lower cost.

#define HELP_VOID_TEXT "Name: void\n==> the functional result of a side-effect or empty argument resp. the correponding type\n\nUsage: \n   void : void | type type\n\nDescription: \n   * The variable void represents the functional result of a\n   side-effect or an empty argument.  It is used only in combination with\n   the applications of identifiers bound through externalproc to\n   external procedures. \n    \n   The void result produced by an external procedure is not printed at\n   the prompt. However, it is possible to print it out in a print\n   statement or in complex data types such as lists. \n    \n   The void argument is implicit when giving not argument to an external\n   procedure when applied. It can be explicited nevertheless.  For\n   example, suppose that foo is an external procedure with a void\n   argument. Then foo() and foo(void) are correct calls to foo.\n\n   * void is used also as a type identifier for\n   externalproc. Typically, an external procedure taking void as an\n   argument or returning void is bound with a signature void ->\n   some type or some type -> void.  See externalproc for more\n   details.\n\nExample 1: \n   > print(void);\n   void\n   > void;\n\nExample 2: \n   > bashexecute(\"gcc -fPIC -Wall -c externalprocvoidexample.c\");\n   > bashexecute(\"gcc -fPIC -shared -o externalprocvoidexample externalprocvoidexample.o\");\n   > externalproc(foo, \"./externalprocvoidexample\", void -> void);\n   > foo;\n   foo(void) -> void\n   > foo();\n   Hello from the external world.\n   > foo(void);\n   Hello from the external world.\n   > print(foo());\n   Hello from the external world.\n   void\n\nSee also: error, externalproc\n"
