See the detailed description below.\n   {P} (optional) is the minimax polynomial to be considered for solving the problem.\n\nDescription: \n   * fpminimax uses a heuristic (but practically efficient) method to find a good\\n   polynomial approximation of a function {f} on an interval {range}. It \\n   implements the method published in the article: \\n   Efficient polynomial L^\\infty - approximations \\n   Nicolas Brisebarre and Sylvain Chevillard \\n   Proceedings of the 18th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic (ARITH 18) \\n   pp. 169-176\\n\n   * The basic usage of this command is fpminimax({f}, {n}, {formats}, {range}).\\n   It computes a polynomial approximation of f with degree at most n\\n   on the interval {range}. {formats} is a list of integers or format types \\n   (such as double, doubledouble, etc.). The polynomial returned by the\\n   command has its coefficients that fit the formats indications. For \\n   instance, if formats[0] is 35, the coefficient of degree 0 of the \\n   polynomial will fit a floating-point format of 35 bits. If formats[1] \\n   is D, the coefficient of degree 1 will be representable by a floating-point\\n   number with a precision of 53 bits (which is not necessarily an IEEE 754 double\\n   precision number. See the remark below), etc.\\n\n   * The second argument may be either an integer or a list of integers\\n   interpreted as the list of desired monomials. For instance, the list\\n   [|0,2,4,6|] indicates that the polynomial must be even and of\\n   degree at most 6. Giving an integer n as second argument is equivalent\\n   as giving [|0,...,n|]. \\n   The list of formats is interpreted with respect to the list of monomials. For\\n   instance, if the list of monomials is [|0,2,4,6|] and the list\\n   of formats is [|161,107,53,24|], the coefficients of degree 0 is \\n   searched as a floating-point number with precision 161, the coefficient of \\n   degree 2 is searched as a number of precision 107, and so on.\\n\n   * The list of formats may contain either integers or format types (double,\\n   doubledouble, tripledouble and doubleextended). The list may be too large\\n   or even infinite. Only the first indications will be considered. For \\n   instance, for a degree n polynomial, formats[n+1] and above will\\n   be discarded. This lets one use elliptical indications for the last\\n   coefficients.\\n\n   * The floating-point coefficients considered by fpminimax do not have an\\n   exponent range. In particular, in the format list, double or 53 does not\\n   imply that the corresponding coefficient is an IEEE-754 double.\\n\n   * By default, the list of formats is interpreted as a list of floating-point\\n   formats. This may be changed by passing fixed as an optional argument (see\\n   below). Let us take an example: fpminimax(f, 2, [107, DD, 53], [0;1]).\\n   Here the optional argument is missing (we could have set it to floating).\\n   Thus, fpminimax will search for a polynomial of degree 2 with a constant \\n   coefficient that is a 107 bits floating-point number, etc. \\n   Currently, doubledouble is just a synonym for 107 and tripledouble a \\n   synonym for 161. This behavior may change in the future (taking into\\n   account the fact that some double-doubles are not representable with\\n   107 bits). \\n   Second example: fpminimax(f, 2, [25, 18, 30], [0;1], fixed).\\n   In this case, fpminimax will search for a polynomial of degree 2 with a\\n   constant coefficient of the form m/2^25 where m is an\\n   integer. In other words, it is a fixed-point number with 25 bits after\\n   the point. Note that even with argument fixed, the formats list is \\n   allowed to contain double, doubledouble or tripledouble. In this this\\n   case, it is just a synonym for 53, 107 or 161. This is deprecated and may\\n   change in the future.\\n\n   * The fourth argument may be a range or a list. Lists are for advanced users\\n   that know what they are doing. The core of the  method is a kind of\\n   approximated interpolation. The list given here is a list of points that\\n   must be considered for the interpolation. It must contain at least as \\n   many points as unknown coefficients. If you give a list, it is also \\n   recommended that you provide the minimax polynomial as last argument.\\n   If you give a range, the list of points will be automatically computed.\\n\n   * The fifth, sixth and seventh arguments are optional. By default, fpminimax\\n   will approximate f while optimizing the relative error, and interpreting\\n   the list of formats as a list of floating-point formats. \\n   This default behavior may be changed with these optional arguments. You\\n   may provide zero, one, two or three of the arguments in any order.\\n   This lets the user indicate only the non-default arguments. \\n   The three possible arguments are:  \\n       - relative or absolute: the error to be optimized;\\n       - floating or fixed: formats of the coefficients;\\n       - a constrained part q.\\n    \\n   The constrained part lets the user assign in advance some of the\\n   coefficients. For instance, for approximating exp(x), it may\\n   be interesting to search for a polynomial p of the form\\n                   p = 1 + x + x^2/2 + a3 x^3 + a4 x^4.\\n   Thus, there is a constrained part q = 1 + x + x^2/2 and the unknown\\n   polynomial should be considered in the monomial basis [|3, 4|].\\n   Calling fpminimax with monomial basis [|3,4|] and constrained\\n   part q, will return a polynomial with the right form.\\n\n   * The last argument is for advanced users. It is the minimax polynomial that\\n   approximates the function f in the monomial basis. If it is not given\\n   this polynomial will be automatically computed by fpminimax.\\n    \\n   This minimax polynomial is used to compute the list of interpolation\\n   points required by the method. In general, you do not have to provide this\\n   argument. But if you want to obtain several polynomials of the same degree\\n   that approximate the same function on the same range, just changing the\\n   formats, you should probably consider computing only once the minimax\\n   polynomial and the list of points instead of letting fpminimax recompute\\n   them each time.\\n    \\n   Note that in the case when a constrained part is given, the minimax \\n   polynomial must take that into account. For instance, in the previous\\n   example, the minimax would be obtained by the following command:\\n          P = remez(1-(1+x+x^2/2)/exp(x), [|3,4|], range, 1/exp(x));\\n   Note that the constrained part is not to be added to P.\\n\n   * Note that fpminimax internally computes a minimax polynomial (using\\n   the same algorithm as remez command). Thus fpminimax may encounter\\n   the same problems as remez. In particular, it may be very slow \\n   when Haar condition is not fulfilled. Another consequence is that\\n   currently fpminimax has to be run with a sufficiently high working precision.\\n\nExample 1: \n\nExample 2: \n\nExample 3: \n\nExample 4: \n\nSee also: remez, dirtyfindzeros, absolute, relative, fixed, floating, default\n"

The\\n   argument {format} indicates the double, double-double or triple-double\\n   format of the variable in which the polynomial varies, influencing\\n   also in the signature of the C function.\\n    \\n   If a seventh or eighth argument {proof filename} is given and if this\\n   argument evaluates to a variable of type string, the command\\n   implementpoly will produce a Gappa proof that the\\n   rounding error is less than the given bound. This proof will be output\\n   in Gappa syntax in a file name {proof filename}.\\n    \\n   The command implementpoly returns the polynomial that has been\\n   implemented. As the command implementpoly tries to adapt the precision\\n   needed in each evaluation step to its strict minimum and as it applies\\n   renormalization to double-double and triple-double precision\\n   coefficients to bring them to a round-to-nearest expansion form, the\\n   returned polynomial may differ from the polynomial\\n   {polynomial}. Nevertheless the difference will be small enough that\\n   the rounding error bound with regard to the polynomial {polynomial}\\n   (estimated at its first order) will be less than the given error\\n   bound.\\n    \\n   If a seventh argument {honor coefficient precisions} is given and\\n   evaluates to a variable honorcoeffprec of type honorcoeffprec,\\n   implementpoly will honor the precision of the given polynomial\\n   {polynomials}. This means if a coefficient needs a double-double or a\\n   triple-double to be exactly stored, implementpoly will allocate appropriate\\n   space and use a double-double or triple-double operation even if the\\n   automatic (heuristic) determination implemented in command implementpoly\\n   indicates that the coefficient could be stored on less precision or,\\n   respectively, the operation could be performed with less\\n   precision. The use of honorcoeffprec has advantages and\\n   disadvantages. If the polynomial {polynomial} given has not been\\n   determined by a process considering directly polynomials with\\n   floating-point coefficients, honorcoeffprec should not be\\n   indicated. The implementpoly command can then determine the needed\\n   precision using the same error estimation as used for the\\n   determination of the precisions of the operations. Generally, the\\n   coefficients will get rounded to double, double-double and\\n   triple-double precision in a way that minimizes their number and\\n   respects the rounding error bound {error bound}.  Indicating\\n   honorcoeffprec may in this case short-circuit most precision\\n   estimations leading to sub-optimal code. On the other hand, if the\\n   polynomial {polynomial} has been determined with floating-point\\n   precisions in mind, honorcoeffprec should be indicated because such\\n   polynomials often are very sensitive in terms of error propagation with\\n   regard to their coefficients' values. Indicating honorcoeffprec\\n   prevents the implementpoly command from rounding the coefficients and\\n   altering by many orders of magnitude the approximation error of the\\n   polynomial with regard to the function it approximates.\\n    \\n   The implementer behind the implementpoly command makes some assumptions on\\n   its input and verifies them. If some assumption cannot be verified,\\n   the implementation will not succeed and implementpoly will evaluate to a\\n   variable error of type error. The same behaviour is observed if\\n   some file is not writable or some other side-effect fails, e.g. if\\n   the implementer runs out of memory.\\n    \\n   As error estimation is performed only on the first order, the code\\n   produced by the implementpoly command should be considered valid iff a\\n   Gappa proof has been produced and successfully run\\n   in Gappa.\\n\nExample 1: \n\nExample 2: \n\nExample 3: \n\nExample 4: \n\nSee also: honorcoeffprec, roundcoefficients, double, doubledouble, tripledouble, readfile, printexpansion, error\n"

Upon such an\\n   application, the Sollya interpreter applies the actual parameters to\\n   the formal parameters {formal parameter1} through {formal parameter n}\\n   (resp. builds up the list of arguments and applies it to the list\\n   {formal list parameter}) and executes the {procedure body}. The\\n   procedure applied to actual parameters evaluates then to the\\n   expression {expression} in the return statement after the <procedure\\n   body> or to void, if no return statement is given (i.e. a return\\n   void statement is implicitly given).\\n\n   * Sollya procedures defined by proc have no name. They can be bound\\n   to an identifier by assigning the procedure object a proc\\n   expression produces to an identifier. However, it is possible to use\\n   procedures without giving them any name. For instance, Sollya\\n   procedures, i.e. procedure objects, can be elements of lists. They can\\n   even be given as an argument to other internal Sollya procedures. See\\n   also procedure on this subject.\\n\n   * Upon definition of a Sollya procedure using proc, no type check\\n   is performed. More precisely, the statements in {procedure body} are\\n   merely parsed but not interpreted upon procedure definition with\\n   proc. Type checks are performed once the procedure is applied to\\n   actual parameters or to void. At this time, if the procedure was\\n   defined using several different formal parameters {formal parameter 1}\\n   through {formal parameter n}, it is checked whether the number of\\n   actual parameters corresponds to the number of formal parameters. If\\n   the procedure was defined using the syntax for a procedure with an\\n   arbitrary number of parameters by giving a {formal list parameter},\\n   the number of actual arguments is not checked but only a list <formal\\n   list parameter> of appropriate length is built up. Type checks are\\n   further performed upon execution of each statement in {procedure body}\\n   and upon evaluation of the expression {expression} to be returned.\\n    \\n   Procedures defined by proc containing a quit or restart command\\n   cannot be executed (i.e. applied). Upon application of a procedure,\\n   the Sollya interpreter checks beforehand for such a statement. If one\\n   is found, the application of the procedure to its arguments evaluates\\n   to error. A warning is displayed. Remark that in contrast to other\\n   type or semantic correctness checks, this check is really performed\\n   before interpreting any other statement in the body of the procedure.\\n\n   * Through the var keyword it is possible to declare local\\n   variables and thus to have full support of recursive procedures. This\\n   means a procedure defined using proc may contain in its {procedure body} \\n   an application of itself to some actual parameters: it suffices\\n   to assign the procedure (object) to an identifier with an appropriate\\n   name.\\n\n   * Sollya procedures defined using proc may return other\\n   procedures. Further {procedure body} may contain assignments of\\n   locally defined procedure objects to identifiers.

However, if {expri} is of type list and this list\\n   contains a variable of type string, the expression for the list\\n   is displayed, i.e.  all character sequences get displayed surrounded\\n   by quotes (\"). Nevertheless, escape sequences used upon defining\\n   character sequences are interpreted immediately.\\n\nExample 1: \n\nExample 2: \n\nExample 3: \n\nExample 4: \n\nSee also: print, printexpansion, printhexa, printfloat, printxml, readfile, autosimplify, display, midpointmode, fullparentheses, evaluate\n"
