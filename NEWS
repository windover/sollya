Changes from version 1.0 to version 1.1:

Critical bug fixes:
  * Patched expansion of polynomial terms. Signs and coefficient values could be completely wrong
    All results previously obtained using Sollya should be re-checked


Changes of syntax and output:
  * Unary + and - are now correctly parsed
  * Changes in midpointmode. In particular, midpoint values are now parsed back as ranges.
  * Changed implicit parenthesation order for power operator ^: 2^3^4 is now understood as 2^(3^4)
  * Integers and binary representations are now read without rounding (see documentation for details)
  * Added infty, @Inf@, nan, NaN, NAN, @NaN@ lexing/parsing capability


Major new functionnalities:
  * Remez' algorithm is now able to correctly handle cases where the Haar condition is not fulfilled
  * Added fpminimax command (see documentation for details)
  * Added ~ operator for evaluating constant expressions
  * Added roundingwarnings mode (see documentation for details)


Improvements in internal handling:
  * Speeded up dirtyfindzeros when 0 is a zero of the function
  * Improvement in execution speed of guessdegree


Others:
  * Fixes of many slight bugs and memory leaks
  * Made Sollya compile under Cygwin (Sollya library untested)
  * Removed dependance to PARI/GP
  * New dependency to Damien Stehle's fplll library
  * Added --help, --oldrlwrapcompatible, --nocolor and --noprompt command-line options
  * Added check environment
  * Added color printing
