Changes from version 1.1 to version 2.0:
========================================
Changes of syntax and output:
  * When the evaluation of an expression seems to be zero but cannot be proven to be exactly zero, the value zero is now returned (instead of a very small value as before)
  * Added %precision%constant parsing capability for numerical point constants
  * printhexa, printfloat are now deprecated. They should be replaced by printdouble and printsingle
  * Syntax like prec = ? is still supported but deprecated. It should be replaced by prec (or any other global variable)
  * The syntax *< interval >*, *< interval >_, *<interval>. is deprecated. It should be replaced by sup(), inf() and mid()
  * The read keyword is deprecated. It should be replaced by #include or even execute()
  * The begin and end keywords are deprecated. They should be replaced by { and }
  * Polymorphic prepend :: is now deprecated. It should be replaced by .: and :.

Major new functionnalities:
  * Added nearestint function
  * Added single precision rounding function
  * Added taylorform command
  * Added autodiff command
  * Added numberroots command
  * Added support for procedures with an arbitrary number of arguments
  * Added time command
  * Made Sollya accept an input file as a command line argument (in particular, it makes shebangs possible)
  * Updated parse command with all new functionnalities
  * Added rationalmode mode
  * Added support for interval arithmetic
  * Added "in" operator for testing if a value belongs to an interval
  * Equality and inequality tests now automatically adapt the precision for guaranteeing safe results whenever possible (or display a warning)

Minor new functionnalities:
  * Added dieonerror mode
  * Added --flush option to Sollya
  * Added support for integer arguments in nop
  * Extended syntax of roundcoefficients command
  * Extended syntax of round command

Improvements in internal handling:
  * Added smart sign test used for proving that some constant expressions are constant zero
  * Made exact simplifier simplify things like D(sin(3)), ceil(log(pi)), etc. where possible with a little more than the working precision
  * Improvement of fpminimax (some infinite loops are now avoided)
  * Infinities and NaN behavior is now IEEE-like
  * Rewrote dirtyinfnorm command and remez command for better performance
  * Randomized sampling in plot in order to avoid regular patterns

Others:
  * Enable linkage of sollya.h with C++
  * Added -Xlinker --allow-multiple-definition for CygWin users
  * Added --help option
  * Slight changes in the behavior of autoprint. Introduced new option --oldautoprint for recovering the old behavior
  * The option --oldrlwrapcompatible is now deprecated. Users should use a recent version of rlwrap supporting "-A" option.

And fixes many bug.



Changes from version 1.0 to version 1.1:
========================================
Critical bug fixes:
  * Patched expansion of polynomial terms. Signs and coefficient values could be completely wrong
    All results previously obtained using Sollya should be re-checked


Changes of syntax and output:
  * Unary + and - are now correctly parsed
  * Changes in midpointmode. In particular, midpoint values are now parsed back as ranges.
  * Changed implicit parenthesation order for power operator ^: 2^3^4 is now understood as 2^(3^4)
  * Integers and binary representations are now read without rounding (see documentation for details)
  * Added infty, @Inf@, nan, NaN, NAN, @NaN@ lexing/parsing capability


Major new functionnalities:
  * Remez' algorithm is now able to correctly handle cases where the Haar condition is not fulfilled
  * Added fpminimax command (see documentation for details)
  * Added ~ operator for evaluating constant expressions
  * Added roundingwarnings mode (see documentation for details)


Improvements in internal handling:
  * Speeded up dirtyfindzeros when 0 is a zero of the function
  * Improvement in execution speed of guessdegree


Others:
  * Fixes of many slight bugs and memory leaks
  * Made Sollya compile under Cygwin (Sollya library untested)
  * Removed dependance to PARI/GP
  * New dependency to Damien Stehle's fplll library
  * Added --help, --oldrlwrapcompatible, --nocolor and --noprompt command-line options
  * Added check environment
  * Added color printing
