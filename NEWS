Changes from version 2.9 to 3.0:
================================
Major new functionnalities:
  * Added expression matching support to the Sollya language. It is
    now possible to perform pattern matching on the objects of the
    Sollya language (expressions, lists, intervals, etc.). This is
    documented in a new section called "Pattern matching" in the
    User's Manual.
  * Added bashevaluate command.
  * Added operators halfprecision (or equivalently HP) and quad (or
    equivalently QD).

Minor new functionnalities:
  * The Sollya executable now returns a meaningful error code:
      0 - the tool has been quit with a "quit;"
      1 - the tool has died because of an internal error that should
          never happen
      2 - the tool has died because it was in "dieonerrormode = on"
          and an error has occurred
      3 - the tool has been quit without a "quit;" but the last
          command was syntactically correct and got correctly executed
      4 - the tool has been quit on an incomplete input
  * Added a fitfth optional argument to guessdegree that is used as a
    maximal allowed degree.
  * Changed behavior of doubleextended (resp. DE) with respect to
    subnormal rounding. Now, doubleextended correctly performs
    subnormal rounding for an exponent width of 15 bits.
    (see documentation on doubleextended for details).

Improvements in internal handling:
  * A new technique gives sharper remainder bounds when taylorform
    is used in relative mode.

Others:
  * Sollya was not compatible with FPLLL 3.0 or later. This is now
    fixed.
  * Two important bugs fixed in taylorform. Results obtained with an older
    version of taylorform often were incorrect.

And some bugs fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from version 2.0 to 2.9:
================================
Changes of syntax and output:
  * The addition of the min and max commands (see below) reserves the
    identifiers min and max as Sollya keywords, impacting legacy
    scripts which might have used these identifiers as variable names

Major new functionnalities:
  * Added supnorm command
  * Added libraryconstant command
  * Added implementconstant command
  * Added function command for turning procedures into functions
  * Added support for user-defined structures into the Sollya language
  * Added min and max commands

Minor new functionnalities:
  * Added --warnonstderr, --warninfile and --warninfileappend options
    to Sollya
  * Added MPFR, GMP and MPFI version printing to version and --help

Improvements in internal handling:

  * Equality and inequality tests optimized when simple interval
    evaluation allows the result to be immediately decided upon.
  * Added a wrapper around MPFI for interval arithmetic computations
    within Sollya. As a consequence, the behaviors of Sollya and MPFI
    on some operations may now be different. See the new Appendix in
    the user's manual.
  * For the users of libsollya: new sollya_mpfi_t type must now be
    used instead of mpfi_t. Currently, they are exactly the same type,
    but they might differ in future versions.
  * The performance of Sollya's internal algorithms used for shifting
    a polynomial have been greatly improved. There is still headroom,
    though.

Others:
  * Multiplications, divisions or powers involving infinities, zeros,
    or NaNs now produce different results, compared to older versions
    of Sollya. This is documented in the new Appendix of the user's
    manual.

And some bugs fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from version 1.1 to version 2.0:
========================================
Changes of syntax and output:

  * When the evaluation of an expression seems to be zero but cannot
    be proven to be exactly zero, the value zero is now returned
    (instead of a very small value as before)
  * Added %precision%constant parsing capability for numerical point
    constants
  * printhexa, printfloat are now deprecated. They should be replaced
    by printdouble and printsingle
  * Syntax like prec = ? is still supported but deprecated. It should
    be replaced by prec (or any other global variable).
  * The syntax *< interval >*, *< interval >_, *<interval>. is
    deprecated. It should be replaced by sup(), inf() and mid()
  * The read keyword is deprecated. It should be replaced by #include
    or even execute()
  * The begin and end keywords are deprecated. They should be replaced
    by { and }
  * Polymorphic prepend :: is now deprecated. It should be replaced by
    .: and :.

Major new functionnalities:
  * Added nearestint function
  * Added single precision rounding function
  * Added taylorform command
  * Added autodiff command
  * Added numberroots command
  * Added support for procedures with an arbitrary number of arguments
  * Added time command
  * Made Sollya accept an input file as a command line argument (in
    particular, it makes shebangs possible)
  * Updated parse command with all new functionnalities
  * Added rationalmode mode
  * Added support for interval arithmetic
  * Added "in" operator for testing if a value belongs to an interval
  * Equality and inequality tests now automatically adapt the
    precision for guaranteeing safe results whenever possible (or
    display a warning)

Minor new functionnalities:
  * Added dieonerror mode
  * Added --flush option to Sollya
  * Added support for integer arguments in nop
  * Extended syntax of roundcoefficients command
  * Extended syntax of round command

Improvements in internal handling:

  * Added smart sign test used for proving that some constant
    expressions are constant zero
  * Made exact simplifier simplify things like D(sin(3)),
    ceil(log(pi)), etc. where possible with a little more than the
    working precision
  * Improvement of fpminimax (some infinite loops are now avoided)
  * Infinities and NaN behavior is now IEEE 754-like
  * Rewrote dirtyinfnorm command and remez command for better
    performance
  * Randomized sampling in plot in order to avoid regular patterns

Others:
  * Enable linkage of sollya.h with C++
  * Added -Xlinker --allow-multiple-definition for CygWin users
  * Added --help option
  * Slight changes in the behavior of autoprint. Introduced new option
    --oldautoprint for recovering the old behavior
  * The option --oldrlwrapcompatible is now deprecated. Users should
    use a recent version of rlwrap supporting "-A" option.

And many bugs fixed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes from version 1.0 to version 1.1:
========================================
Critical bug fixes:
  * Patched expansion of polynomial terms. Signs and coefficient
    values could be completely wrong All results previously obtained
    using Sollya should be re-checked

Changes of syntax and output:
  * Unary + and - are now correctly parsed
  * Changes in midpointmode. In particular, midpoint values are now
    parsed back as ranges.
  * Changed implicit parenthesation order for power operator ^: 2^3^4
    is now understood as 2^(3^4)
  * Integers and binary representations are now read without rounding
    (see documentation for details)
  * Added infty, @Inf@, nan, NaN, NAN, @NaN@ lexing/parsing capability

Major new functionnalities:
  * Remez' algorithm is now able to correctly handle cases where the
    Haar condition is not fulfilled
  * Added fpminimax command (see documentation for details)
  * Added ~ operator for evaluating constant expressions
  * Added roundingwarnings mode (see documentation for details)

Improvements in internal handling:
  * Speeded up dirtyfindzeros when 0 is a zero of the function
  * Improvement in execution speed of guessdegree

Others:
  * Fixes of many slight bugs and memory leaks
  * Made Sollya compile under Cygwin (Sollya library untested)
  * Removed dependance to PARI/GP
  * New dependency to Damien Stehle's fplll library
  * Added --help, --oldrlwrapcompatible, --nocolor and --noprompt
    command-line options
  * Added check environment
  * Added color printing
