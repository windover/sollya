Sollya is a computer program whose purpose is to provide an
environment for safe floating-point code development. It is
particularily targeted to the automatized implementation of
mathematical floating-point libraries (libm). Amongst other features,
it offers a certified infinite norm, an automatic polynomial
implementer and a fast Remez algorithm.


In order to compile the software you will need the following packages installed:

- gcc
- bison version 2.3 or later
- flex version 2.5.33 or later
- gnuplot
- gmp
- mpfr 2.2.0 or later
- mpfi
- pari version 2.3.0
- libxml2-dev

In order to compile, use the makefile by invoking it using the following command:

./configure
make

When compiling a fresh svn checkout, launch first the autogen.sh Shell
script before executing the two steps indicated above.

You can then use the software typing

./sollya

or install it with:

make install

The use of the readline-wrapper rlwrap is highly recommended for interactive 
work with sollya.
