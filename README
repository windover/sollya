Sollya is a computer program whose purpose is to provide an
environment for safe floating-point code development. It is
particularily targeted to the automatized implementation of
mathematical floating-point libraries (libm). Amongst other features,
it offers a certified infinite norm, an automatic polynomial
implementer and a fast Remez algorithm.


In order to compile the software you will need the following packages installed:

- gcc
- g++ version 4.2 or below.
- gnuplot
- gmp
- mpfr 2.2.0 or later
- mpfi
- libxml2-dev
- fplll (available at url http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/damien.stehle/english.html#software)

- bison version 2.3 or later
- flex version 2.5.33 or later

*IMPORTANT WARNING*: the current version of fplll (2.1) requires to be compiled
with g++ version 4.2 or below. Trying to compile with the last version
of g++ (4.3) will lead to a compilation error.
Furhtermore, you need to compile Sollya with g++ version 4.2 or below as well.
You may specify to use a particular version of g++ by configuring with:

             ./configure CXX="g++-4.2"


Bison and flex are really needed if you compile a fresh svn checkout or if you modify
the grammar files contained in the distribution. Otherwise, precompiled versions
are found in the distribution and can be used.

In order to compile, use the makefile by invoking it using the following command:

./configure
make

When compiling a fresh svn checkout, launch first the autogen.sh shell
script before executing the two steps indicated above. 
Users compiling fresh svn checkouts are recommanded to use the 
--enable-strict-lexer-parser-check option of the configure script.


You can then use the software typing

./sollya

or install it with:

make install

The use of the readline-wrapper rlwrap is highly recommended for interactive 
work with sollya.
