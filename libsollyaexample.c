This software is a computer program whose purpose is to provide an
environment for safe floating-point code development. It is
particularily targeted to the automatized implementation of
mathematical floating-point libraries (libm). Amongst other features,
it offers a certified infinity norm, an automatic polynomial
implementer and a fast Remez algorithm.

/* Example for the usage of libsollya

   Compile with something similar to

       gcc -Wall -c libsollyaexample.c
       gcc -L./.libs -Wall -o libsollyaexample libsollyaexample.o -lsollya


   The example...

   1.) Initializes the library
   2.) Computes a Remez polynomial for log(1 + x) with relative error
   3.) Computes a Remez polynomial for log(1 + x) with relative error with wrong base
   4.) Calls error handler because of failure
   5.) Frees the library

   The usage of the recovering functionality is not mandatory. In the case
   of an error the library ends the program with return code 1.
