	* README, fpminimax.cpp: Fpminimax exhibitted an infinite loop in a
	  particular case.
	  When the coefficients are floating-point numbers, the algorithm
	  has to guess the exponents of the coefficients first.
	  Then, fpminimax is launched and we check afterwards that the
	  coefficients have the same exponent as we guessed.
	  If it is not the case, we correct the exponents and loop.
	  
	  I knew that it could lead theoretically to an infinite loop. Yet,
	  it was never oberved in practice.
	  Mioara found the following instance that effectively leads to an
	  infinite loop:
	  f=sqrt(x); d=[1+12/512, 1+13/512]; fpminimax(f, 2, [|18, 10,
	  14|], d);
	  
	  It turns out that the algorithm loops over the two polynomials
	  p=-1.00100001000101_2 * 2^(-3) * x^2 + 1.10010001_2 * 2^(-1) * x
	  + 1.0110111010000111_2 * 2^(-2)
	  q=-1.100110000101_2 * 2^(-4) * x^2 + 1.011001011_2 * 2^(-1) * x +
	  1.10011011000101111_2 * 2^(-2)
	  
	  Surprinsingly, the coefficients of x^2 is not the same at all in
	  both polynomials.
	  
	  I patched the algorithm with the following trick: when more than
	  MAXLOOP trials have been performed, we stop as soon as a
	  polynomial fits in the formats.
	  This still ensures that the result of the algorithm has the good
	  form. This avoids the previous infinite loop but the theoretical
	  possibility of an infinite loop stays.
